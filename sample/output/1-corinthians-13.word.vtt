Paul

00:02.800 --> 00:03.380
discusses

5
00:03.380 --> 00:03.520
the

6
00:03.520 --> 00:03.740
high

7
00:03.740 --> 00:04.220
status

8
00:04.220 --> 00:04.520
of

9
00:04.520 --> 00:05.840
charityâ€”

10
00:05.840 --> 00:06.480
Charity,

11
00:06.780 --> 00:06.880
a

12
00:06.880 --> 00:07.180
pure

13
00:07.180 --> 00:07.540
love,

14
00:07.980 --> 00:08.380
excels

15
00:08.380 --> 00:08.800
and

16
00:08.800 --> 00:09.240
exceeds

17
00:09.240 --> 00:09.780
almost

18
00:09.780 --> 00:10.280
all

19
00:10.280 --> 00:10.560
else.

20
00:11.600 --> 00:11.740
1 Though

21
00:11.740 --> 00:11.940
I

22
00:11.940 --> 00:12.280
speak

23
00:12.280 --> 00:12.660
with

24
00:12.660 --> 00:12.840
the

25
00:12.840 --> 00:13.180
tongues

26
00:13.180 --> 00:13.440
of

27
00:13.460 --> 00:13.780
men

28
00:13.780 --> 00:14.200
and

29
00:14.200 --> 00:14.340
of

30
00:14.340 --> 00:14.700
angels,

31
00:15.280 --> 00:15.400
and

32
00:15.400 --> 00:15.580
have

33
00:15.580 --> 00:15.800
not

34
00:15.800 --> 00:16.460
charity,

35
00:17.080 --> 00:17.220
I

36
00:17.220 --> 00:17.380
am

37
00:17.380 --> 00:17.760
become

38
00:17.760 --> 00:18.080
as

39
00:18.080 --> 00:18.520
sounding

40
00:18.520 --> 00:18.980
brass,

41
00:19.620 --> 00:19.740
or

42
00:19.740 --> 00:19.880
a

43
00:19.880 --> 00:20.260
tinkling

44
00:20.260 --> 00:20.900
cymbal.

45
00:21.560 --> 00:21.660
2 And

46
00:21.660 --> 00:21.880
though

47
00:21.880 --> 00:22.120
I

48
00:22.120 --> 00:22.360
have

49
00:22.360 --> 00:22.600

50
00:22.600 --> 00:22.900
gift

51
00:23.000 --> 00:23.120
of

52
00:23.120 --> 00:23.220
prophecy,

53
00:24.260 --> 00:24.400
and

54
00:24.400 --> 00:24.900
understand

55
00:24.900 --> 00:25.320
all

56
00:25.320 --> 00:25.740
mysteries,

57
00:26.260 --> 00:26.360
and

58
00:26.360 --> 00:26.540
all

59
00:26.540 --> 00:27.600
knowledge;

60
00:27.620 --> 00:27.720
and

61
00:27.720 --> 00:27.920
though

62
00:27.920 --> 00:28.120
I

63
00:28.120 --> 00:28.400
have

64
00:28.400 --> 00:28.700
all

65
00:28.700 --> 00:29.080
faith,

66
00:29.840 --> 00:29.980
so

67
00:30.020 --> 00:30.180
that

68
00:30.180 --> 00:30.340
I

69
00:30.340 --> 00:30.540
could

70
00:30.540 --> 00:30.960
remove

71
00:30.960 --> 00:31.440

00:32.360 --> 00:32.640
not

75
00:32.640 --> 00:33.120

76
00:33.960 --> 00:34.100
I

77
00:34.100 --> 00:34.260

78
00:34.260 --> 00:34.580

79
00:35.820 --> 00:35.820
3 And

80
00:35.820 --> 00:36.000

81
00:36.000 --> 00:36.220
I

82
00:36.220 --> 00:36.740

89
00:38.500 --> 00:38.860

90
00:39.440 --> 00:39.540
and

91
00:39.540 --> 00:39.760

92
00:39.760 --> 00:39.920
I

93
00:39.920 --> 00:40.080

99
00:41.940 --> 00:42.060
and

100
00:42.060 --> 00:42.280

186
01:27.440 --> 01:27.900

187
01:28.740 --> 01:28.840
9 For

188
01:28.840 --> 01:29.020
we

189
01:29.020 --> 01:29.260
know

190
01:29.340 --> 01:29.560
in

191
01:29.560 --> 01:29.880
part,

192
01:30.420 --> 01:30.520
and

193
01:30.520 --> 01:30.680
we

194
01:30.680 --> 01:31.400
prophesy

195
01:31.400 --> 01:31.820
in

196
01:31.820 --> 01:32.100
part.

197
01:33.140 --> 01:33.140
10 But

198
01:33.140 --> 01:33.360
when

199
01:33.360 --> 01:33.580
that

200
01:33.580 --> 01:33.820
which

201
01:33.820 --> 01:34.040
is

202
01:34.200 --> 01:34.460
perfect

203
01:34.460 --> 01:34.840
is

204
01:34.840 --> 01:35.180
come,

205
01:35.740 --> 01:35.880
then

206
01:35.880 --> 01:36.080
that

207
01:36.080 --> 01:36.340
which

208
01:36.340 --> 01:36.540
is

209
01:36.540 --> 01:36.720
in

210
01:36.720 --> 01:37.160
part

211
01:37.440 --> 01:37.540
shall

212
01:37.540 --> 01:37.720
be

213
01:37.720 --> 01:37.940
done

214
01:37.940 --> 01:38.300
away.

215
01:39.100 --> 01:39.180
11 When

216
01:39.180 --> 01:39.360
I

217
01:39.360 --> 01:39.540
was

218
01:39.540 --> 01:39.740
a

219
01:39.740 --> 01:40.100
child,

220
01:40.460 --> 01:40.560
I

221
01:40.560 --> 01:40.980
spake

222
01:40.980 --> 01:41.180
as

223
01:41.180 --> 01:41.300
a

224
01:41.300 --> 01:41.700
child,

225
01:42.360 --> 01:42.460
I

226
01:42.460 --> 01:42.880
understood

227
01:42.880 --> 01:43.600
as

228
01:43.600 --> 01:43.720
a

229
01:43.720 --> 01:44.140
child,

230
01:44.680 --> 01:44.800
I

231
01:44.800 --> 01:45.100
thought

232
01:45.100 --> 01:45.580
as

233
01:45.580 --> 01:45.680
a

234
01:45.680 --> 01:46.120
child:

235
01:46.820 --> 01:46.920
but

236
01:46.920 --> 01:47.120
when

237
01:47.120 --> 01:47.300
I

238
01:47.300 --> 01:47.600
became

239
01:47.600 --> 01:47.900
a

240
01:47.900 --> 01:48.160
man,

241
01:48.800 --> 01:48.900
I

242
01:48.900 --> 01:49.100
put

243
01:49.100 --> 01:49.400
away

244
01:49.400 --> 01:49.960
childish

245
01:49.960 --> 01:50.440
things.

246
01:51.380 --> 01:51.480
12 For

247
01:51.480 --> 01:51.740
now

248
01:51.740 --> 01:52.020
we

249
01:52.020 --> 01:52.340
see

250
01:52.340 --> 01:52.620
through

251
01:52.620 --> 01:52.820
a

252
01:52.820 --> 01:53.180
glass,

253
01:53.420 --> 01:54.260
darkly;

254
