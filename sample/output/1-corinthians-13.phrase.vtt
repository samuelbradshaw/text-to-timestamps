00:00.880 --> 00:01.760
CHAPTER 13

2
00:02.640 --> 00:05.840
Paul discusses the high status of charityâ€”

3
00:05.840 --> 00:09.780
Charity, a pure love, excels and exceeds almost

4
00:09.780 --> 00:10.560
all else.

5
00:11.600 --> 00:14.340
1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of

6
00:14.340 --> 00:18.080
angels, and have not charity, I am become as

7
00:18.080 --> 00:20.900
sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

8
00:21.560 --> 00:24.400
2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and

9
00:24.400 --> 00:27.720
understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and

10
00:27.720 --> 00:30.540
though I have all faith, so that I could

11
00:30.540 --> 00:34.260
remove mountains, and have not charity, I am

12
00:34.260 --> 00:34.580
nothing.

13
00:35.820 --> 00:38.260
3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed

14
00:38.260 --> 00:41.120
the poor, and though I give my body to be

15
00:41.120 --> 00:44.700
burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me

16
00:44.700 --> 00:45.040
nothing.

17
00:45.860 --> 00:49.500
4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity

18
00:49.500 --> 00:53.800
envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is

19
00:53.840 --> 00:54.680
not puffed up,

20
00:55.680 --> 00:59.060
5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not

21
00:59.060 --> 01:02.900
her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh

22
01:02.940 --> 01:03.640
no evil;

23
01:04.540 --> 01:08.080
6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the

24
01:08.080 --> 01:08.480
truth;

25
01:09.520 --> 01:12.060
7 Beareth all things, believeth all things,

26
01:12.660 --> 01:15.500
hopeth all things, endureth all things.

27
01:16.360 --> 01:19.460
8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be

28
01:19.460 --> 01:22.740
prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be

29
01:22.740 --> 01:25.740
tongues, they shall cease; whether there be

30
01:25.740 --> 01:27.900
knowledge, it shall vanish away.

31
01:28.740 --> 01:31.820
9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in

32
01:31.820 --> 01:32.100
part.

33
01:33.140 --> 01:35.180
10 But when that which is perfect is come,

34
01:35.740 --> 01:37.940
then that which is in part shall be done

35
01:37.940 --> 01:38.300
away.

36
01:39.100 --> 01:42.460
11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I

37
01:42.460 --> 01:46.920
understood as a child, I thought as a child: but

38
01:46.920 --> 01:49.960
when I became a man, I put away childish

39
01:49.960 --> 01:50.440
things.

40
01:51.380 --> 01:54.460
12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but

41
01:54.460 --> 01:58.420
then face to face: now I know in part; but

42
01:58.420 --> 02:01.280
then shall I know even as also I am known.

43
02:02.360 --> 02:06.620
13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these

44
02:06.620 --> 02:09.900
three; but the greatest of these is charity.
