"CHAPTER 13

",0.88,1.76
Paul discusses the high status of charityâ€”,2.64,5.84
"Charity, a pure love, excels and exceeds almost ",5.84,9.78
"all else.

",9.78,10.56
1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of ,11.6,14.34
"angels, and have not charity, I am become as ",14.34,18.08
"sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

",18.08,20.9
"2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and ",21.56,24.4
"understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and ",24.4,27.72
"though I have all faith, so that I could ",27.72,30.54
"remove mountains, and have not charity, I am ",30.54,34.26
"nothing.

",34.26,34.58
3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed ,35.82,38.26
"the poor, and though I give my body to be ",38.26,41.12
"burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me ",41.12,44.7
"nothing.

",44.7,45.04
"4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity ",45.86,49.5
"envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is ",49.5,53.8
"not puffed up,

",53.84,54.68
"5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not ",55.68,59.06
"her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh ",59.06,62.9
"no evil;

",62.94,63.64
"6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the ",64.54,68.08
"truth;

",68.08,68.48
"7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, ",69.52,72.06
"hopeth all things, endureth all things.

",72.66,75.5
8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be ,76.36,79.46
"prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be ",79.46,82.74
"tongues, they shall cease; whether there be ",82.74,85.74
"knowledge, it shall vanish away.

",85.74,87.9
"9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in ",88.74,91.82
"part.

",91.82,92.1
"10 But when that which is perfect is come, ",93.14,95.18
then that which is in part shall be done ,95.74,97.94
"away.

",97.94,98.3
"11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I ",99.1,102.46
"understood as a child, I thought as a child: but ",102.46,106.92
"when I became a man, I put away childish ",106.92,109.96
"things.

",109.96,110.44
"12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but ",111.38,114.46
then face to face: now I know in part; but ,114.46,118.42
"then shall I know even as also I am known.

",118.42,121.28
"13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these ",122.36,126.62
three; but the greatest of these is charity.,126.62,129.9
