}

1
00:22.000 --> 00:26.420
1. Come, thou fount of ev’ry blessing,

2
00:27.480 --> 00:31.340
tune my heart to sing thy grace.

3
00:32.820 --> 00:37.380
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,

4
00:38.240 --> 00:41.960
call for songs of loudest praise.

5
00:43.600 --> 00:46.860
Teach me some melodious sonnet

6
00:48.640 --> 00:53.100
sung by flaming tongues above.

7
00:56.120 --> 01:00.340
Praise the mount, I’m fixed upon it,

8
01:00.800 --> 01:05.000
mount of thy redeeming love.

9
01:14.380 --> 01:19.180
2. Here I raise my Ebenezer,

10
01:19.920 --> 01:23.780
hither by thy help I’m come;

11
01:24.980 --> 01:29.220
And I hope, by thy good pleasure,

12
01:29.920 --> 01:34.000
safely to arrive at home.

13
01:35.480 --> 01:39.140
Jesus sought me when a stranger

14
01:39.960 --> 01:44.680
Wand’ring from the fold of God.

15
01:48.080 --> 01:52.320
He, to rescue me from danger

16
01:53.400 --> 01:57.220
interposed His precious blood.

17
02:02.720 --> 02:19.100
3. Oh to grace, how great a debtor

18
02:19.600 --> 02:23.420
daily I’m constrained to be.

19
02:24.360 --> 02:28.760
Let thy goodness like a fetter,

20
02:29.300 --> 02:33.040
bind my wand’ring heart to thee.

21
02:34.100 --> 02:38.420
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;

22
02:38.980 --> 02:45.900
prone to leave the God I love;

23
02:49.140 --> 02:53.980
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,

24
02:54.980 --> 02:58.100
seal it for thy courts above.

25
03:00.420 --> 03:04.680
Seal it for thy courts above.

26
03:14.860 --> 03:20.300
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,

27
03:21.260 --> 03:30.060
seal it for thy courts above.
