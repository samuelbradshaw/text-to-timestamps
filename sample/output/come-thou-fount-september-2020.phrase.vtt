1
00:21.860 --> 00:26.520
1. Come, thou fount of ev’ry blessing,

2
00:27.480 --> 00:31.400
tune my heart to sing thy grace.

3
00:32.680 --> 00:37.420
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,

4
00:38.260 --> 00:42.260
call for songs of loudest praise.

5
00:43.620 --> 00:47.960
Teach me some melodious sonnet

6
00:48.880 --> 00:53.040
sung by flaming tongues above.

7
00:55.780 --> 01:00.340
Praise the mount, I’m fixed upon it,

8
01:00.800 --> 01:04.840
mount of thy redeeming love.

9
01:14.820 --> 01:19.180
2. Here I raise my Ebenezer,

10
01:19.760 --> 01:24.820
hither by thy help I’m come;

11
01:24.900 --> 01:29.220
And I hope, by thy good pleasure,

12
01:29.940 --> 01:33.920
safely to arrive at home.

13
01:35.460 --> 01:39.080
Jesus sought me when a stranger

14
01:40.060 --> 01:44.680
Wand’ring from the fold of God.

15
01:48.000 --> 01:52.460
He, to rescue me from danger

16
01:53.420 --> 01:57.340
interposed His precious blood.

17
02:02.080 --> 02:19.140
3. Oh to grace, how great a debtor

18
02:19.620 --> 02:23.440
daily I’m constrained to be.

19
02:24.380 --> 02:28.780
Let thy goodness like a fetter,

20
02:29.140 --> 02:32.940
bind my wand’ring heart to thee.

21
02:34.200 --> 02:38.900
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;

22
02:39.300 --> 02:46.240
prone to leave the God I love;

23
02:49.200 --> 02:53.940
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,

24
02:54.880 --> 02:58.700
seal it for thy courts above.

25
03:00.460 --> 03:03.900
Seal it for thy courts above.

26
03:14.780 --> 03:20.460
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,

27
03:21.080 --> 03:30.100
seal it for thy courts above.
