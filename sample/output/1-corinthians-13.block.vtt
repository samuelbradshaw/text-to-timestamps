CHAPTER 13

2
00:02.640 --> 00:10.560
Paul discusses the high status of charityâ€”Charity, a pure love, excels and exceeds almost all else.

3
00:11.600 --> 00:20.900
1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

4
00:21.560 --> 00:34.580
2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

5
00:35.820 --> 00:45.040
3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

6
00:45.860 --> 00:54.680
4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

7
00:55.680 --> 01:03.640
5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;

8
01:04.540 --> 01:08.480
6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

9
01:09.520 --> 01:15.500
7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

10
01:16.360 --> 01:27.900
8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

11
01:28.740 --> 01:32.100
9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

12
01:33.140 --> 01:38.300
10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.

13
01:39.100 --> 01:50.440
11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

14
01:51.380 --> 02:01.280
12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.

15
02:02.360 --> 02:09.900
13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
