CHAPTER 13

{"block": 2, "phrase": 1}
00:00:02.712 --> 00:00:04.873
Paul discusses the high status of

{"block": 2, "phrase": 2}
00:00:04.988 --> 00:00:05.563
charityâ€”

{"block": 2, "phrase": 3}
00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:10.437
Charity, a pure love, excels and exceeds

{"block": 2, "phrase": 4}
00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:11.863
almost all else.

{"block": 3, "phrase": 1}
00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:15.542
1 Though I speak with the tongues of men

{"block": 3, "phrase": 2}
00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:19.496
and of angels, and have not charity, I

{"block": 3, "phrase": 3}
00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:22.508
am become as sounding brass, or a

{"block": 3, "phrase": 4}
00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:23.658
tinkling cymbal.

{"block": 4, "phrase": 1}
00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:26.256
2 And though I have the gift of

{"block": 4, "phrase": 2}
00:00:26.394 --> 00:00:29.498
prophecy, and understand all mysteries,

{"block": 4, "phrase": 3}
00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:30.831
and all knowledge;

{"block": 4, "phrase": 4}
00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:34.556
and though I have all faith, so that I

{"block": 4, "phrase": 5}
00:00:34.648 --> 00:00:37.269
could remove mountains, and have not

{"block": 4, "phrase": 6}
00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:39.568
charity, I am nothing.

{"block": 5, "phrase": 1}
00:00:40.787 --> 00:00:43.385
3 And though I bestow all my goods to

{"block": 5, "phrase": 2}
00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:46.581
feed the poor, and though I give my body

{"block": 5, "phrase": 3}
00:00:46.673 --> 00:00:50.122
to be burned, and have not charity, it

{"block": 5, "phrase": 4}
00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:51.616
profiteth me nothing.

{"block": 6, "phrase": 1}
00:00:52.444 --> 00:00:55.502
4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind;

{"block": 6, "phrase": 2}
00:00:56.238 --> 00:00:57.824
charity envieth not;

{"block": 6, "phrase": 3}
00:00:58.698 --> 00:01:01.825
charity vaunteth not itself, is not

{"block": 6, "phrase": 4}
00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:02.584
puffed up,

{"block": 7, "phrase": 1}
00:01:03.687 --> 00:01:06.193
5 Doth not behave itself unseemly,

{"block": 7, "phrase": 2}
00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:10.079
seeketh not her own, is not easily

{"block": 7, "phrase": 3}
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.769
provoked, thinketh no evil;

{"block": 8, "phrase": 1}
00:01:13.827 --> 00:01:16.586
6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but

{"block": 8, "phrase": 2}
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.425
rejoiceth in the truth;

{"block": 9, "phrase": 1}
00:01:19.506 --> 00:01:22.150
7 Beareth all things, believeth all

{"block": 9, "phrase": 2}
00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:26.150
things, hopeth all things, endureth all

{"block": 9, "phrase": 3}
00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:26.656
things.

{"block": 10, "phrase": 1}
00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:29.323
8 Charity never faileth:

{"block": 10, "phrase": 2}
00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:32.726
but whether there be prophecies, they

{"block": 10, "phrase": 3}
00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:33.508
shall fail;

{"block": 10, "phrase": 4}
00:01:34.152 --> 00:01:36.359
whether there be tongues, they shall

{"block": 10, "phrase": 5}
00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:36.865
cease;

{"block": 10, "phrase": 6}
00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:39.831
whether there be knowledge, it shall

{"block": 10, "phrase": 7}
00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:40.796
vanish away.

{"block": 11, "phrase": 1}
00:01:41.693 --> 00:01:44.889
9 For we know in part, and we prophesy

{"block": 11, "phrase": 2}
00:01:45.142 --> 00:01:45.648
in part.

{"block": 12, "phrase": 1}
00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.706
10 But when that which is perfect is

{"block": 12, "phrase": 2}
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:51.879
come, then that which is in part shall

{"block": 12, "phrase": 3}
00:01:51.948 --> 00:01:52.752
be done away.

{"block": 13, "phrase": 1}
00:01:53.603 --> 00:01:56.063
11 When I was a child, I spake as a

{"block": 13, "phrase": 2}
00:01:56.224 --> 00:02:00.179
child, I understood as a child, I

{"block": 13, "phrase": 3}
00:02:00.294 --> 00:02:01.742
thought as a child:

{"block": 13, "phrase": 4}
00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:05.513
but when I became a man, I put away

{"block": 13, "phrase": 5}
00:02:05.697 --> 00:02:06.755
childish things.

{"block": 14, "phrase": 1}
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.905
12 For now we see through a glass,

{"block": 14, "phrase": 2}
00:02:10.065 --> 00:02:10.594
darkly;

{"block": 14, "phrase": 3}
00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.802
but then face to face:

{"block": 14, "phrase": 4}
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.078
now I know in part;

{"block": 14, "phrase": 5}
00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.963
but then shall I know even as also I am

{"block": 14, "phrase": 6}
00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:19.354
known.

{"block": 15, "phrase": 1}
00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:24.390
13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity,

{"block": 15, "phrase": 2}
00:02:25.056 --> 00:02:25.838
these three;

{"block": 15, "phrase": 3}
00:02:26.643 --> 00:02:29.333
but the greatest of these is charity.
